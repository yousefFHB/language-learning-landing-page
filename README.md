## 🎯 Purpose of This Project

This is a **learning project**, created to strengthen my frontend development skills.  
Rebuilding real websites helps me practice:

- Layout analysis  
- Typography and spacing  
- Responsive behavior  
- Clean folder organization  
- CSS architecture  
- Attention to UI details  

I do **not** claim ownership of the original HelloTalk design — this is a non-commercial educational clone.
